                <p style=font-size:30px;>Who is Snoopy?</p>
                <p>Snoopy is the loveable animated beagle featured in Charles M. Schulz Peanuts. He first appeared in the comic strip on October 4, 1950. In his early days, he was often found pretending to be other animals but as his character developed, his imagination took him to bigger places. Two of Snoopy’s most famous aliases are “Joe Cool” and “Flying Ace”. He is the pet and best friend of Charlie Brown. They are the only two Peanuts characters to be present in all movies and specials. He is known for his happy dance and he loves root beer and pizza.</p>

                <p style=color:#faf0e6>"Snoopy’s whole personality is a little bittersweet. But he’s a very strong character. He can win or lose, be a disaster, a hero, or anything, and yet it all works out. I like the fact that when he’s in real trouble, he can retreat into a fantasy and thereby escape."</p>
